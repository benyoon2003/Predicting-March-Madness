March Madness, an annual NCAA basketball tournament, attracts millions of fans as they attempt to predict one of the most challenging creation of brackets ever. The tournament’s
drama and unpredictability draw watchers to test their game knowledge in guessing who will win the tournament. In this project, we leveraged pre-tournament statistics to build three
different regression machine-learning models (SVR, Gradient Boost, Random Forest) to predict teams’ strength as a numeric value, a power ranking (BARTHAG). 
With this data, we ultimately simulate a final matchup to determine the winner of the tournament. The most accurate model produced the winner for 8 out of the 10 years we pulled data from. 
When running the model on 2024 data, it predicted the winner within the final 2 and the finalists within the top 3 seeds.
